# :capital_abcd: Daniel’s spelling game

A very simple game that teaches you how to spell some (Hungarian) words.

You can [play the game here](https://bence-toth.github.io/daniel-spelling-game/).

## Inspiration and acknowledgements

We started building some games together with my (at the time of writing) three-year-old son, Daniel.

He has been very interested in reading letters at a very early age, and I have decided to create this game for him for his 4th birthday, which is on 5 October 2021.

Without him, this could not have happened, I am very proud of him, and I am eternally grateful. :heart:

He has contributed greatly acting as:

- voice actor, authoring all the beautiful sounds in the game,

- model, contributing his perfect little arm as mouse cursor.

This is the third part of a game series made for toddlers and small children. If you are interested, check out the first two games:
